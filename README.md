## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `psutil`, `requests`, `smtplib`, `tkinter` (built-in for most systems)

### 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install psutil requests
```

### 🛠️ Configuration

Edit these variables in the script:

```python
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = "<YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY>"
EMAIL_SENDER = "your_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
EMAIL_RECEIVER = "receiver_email@gmail.com"
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your/webhook/url"
```

### ✅ Run the Tool

```bash
python suspicious_process_detector.py
```

---

## 🗂️ Output

* Log File: `process_monitor_log.json`
* Alerts: Sent instantly to Discord and Email
* GUI: Shows real-time logs and updates

---

## 🧠 Detection Logic

### 🚩 Flags processes that are:

* On the `BLACKLIST` or in the `SUSPICIOUS_PROCESSES` list
* Have a suspicious parent-child relationship (e.g., `explorer.exe → cmd.exe`)
* Detected as malicious by VirusTotal

### ✅ Ignores processes that are:

* On the `WHITELIST`
